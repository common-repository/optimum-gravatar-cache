= 1.4.10 =

* Fixed "needUpdate" PHP variable warning, reported by Bastien.

= 1.4.9 =

* Fix Creation of dynamic property for php 8.2

= 1.4.8 =

* Better check for options when enabled, removes PHP Notices.

= 1.4.7 =

* The method for resetting the cron event has been updated.

= 1.4.6 =

* The plugin did not reset the cron job. This is problematic when clearing the cache and when modifying the "Check for outdated Gravatars every" time in the plugin settings. At this time, whenever the cache is cleared or the cache options are saved, the cron job is reconfigured.

= 1.4.5 =

* From this version any user who has the capability to 'manage_options' can configure the plugin. Until 1.4.4 only Admin could configure the plugin.

= 1.4.4 =

* stripcslashes the apache configuration file.
* Validation with wordpress 5.1.1.

= 1.4.3 =

* Add support for "get_avatar_url" again. Since some themes use this function to display the gravatar.
* Now a better check is made for the existence of plugin options.

= 1.4.2 =

* Now a "wp_optimum_gravatar_cache_urls" table that was created for debugging purposes is removed if it exists when the plugin is activated, the table was accidentally included in version 1.4.0.
* Now a better check is made for the existence of plugin options.
* Fixed: Now when there is support for imagick, but the imagick does not support SVG no longer gives fatal error. It happened when converting the default avatar of type .svg to use with the '= d' option of gravatar.com.

= 1.4.1 =

* Fixed: The avatars were not shown on the administrative pages when the user was not "administrator". The lazyLoadAvatar.js script was not loaded!

= 1.4.0 =

* Because Gravatar.com caches the images used with the '&d=' option for two years, a nomenclature has been implemented based on the contents of the gravatar. These images will only be used as failback for gravatars that have not yet been processed.
* Add support to Cloudflare
* Now the plugin works even when wordpress is installed in a subdirectory.
* Add support to Hummingbird
* Add support to WP Super Cache
* Now the button that allows to clear the cache remains always active since the plugin has been configured.

= 1.3.4 =

* The avatars resolved in each page request are now stored in memory to avoid processing the same avatar multiple times in the same page request.
* Now the proposed directory when installing the plugin for the first time is **wp-content/uploads/optimum-gravatar-cache/**. To be more predictable for users.
* A few checks have been added on the plugin's administrative pages to validate the data before sending them.
* The plugin already works as a must-use plugin (also called a 'mu-plugin').
* It is now checked beforehand if the user has permissions to create the cache directory. Avoiding Warnings in PHP.
* The default language will be from this version 'en_GB' which will be used in all messages in the plugin code.
* From this version no error will be suppressed with '@' all warnings will be forwarded normally. If the user decides to configure his PHP to show the errors in the HTML will be shown. This is because it is a good practice not to suppress errors and it allows to have some debug to be able to solve problems to the users of the plugin.

= 1.3.3 =

* Solving problem with default placeholder.
* Solving problem with default avatar that would disappear if it was updated before saving the cache options.
* Resolving warnings that were reported by @willstockstech that happened when updating from previous versions.

= 1.3.2 =

* Resolving warnings that were reported by @willstockstech.

= 1.3.1 =

* Added "wp-includes / pluggable.php" to resolve at the moment "Call to undefined function wp_get_current_user ()"
* Fix variable name error

= 1.3.0 =

* A complete Lazy Load engine has been added to the plugin so you can save even more bytes. It is quite configurable to adapt and is optional.
* Added an option that allows you to add CSS classes, so you can adapt the avatars to themes and plugins that need a certain class.
* An option has been added that lets you choose whether the domain added to the avatars is resolved from the host returned by the 'site_url ()' or 'content_url ()' functions. This option allows the domain / subdomain returned by 'content_url ()' to be used for avatars links, if configured.
* An option has been added that lets you choose whether to use gravatar until the avatar is cached.
* An option has been added that allows you to choose whether to remove avatars from the cache when they are updated in gravatar and have a different file type. This is important when using cache plugins like 'WP Super Cache'. This way preventing the pages that are cached by these plugins have links to avatars that no longer exist in the cache.
* Now the custom avatar is saved in the cache directory, this is necessary for the avatar not to be deleted in the process of updating the plugin.
* Some option variable names have been modified to follow the same pattern. You will need to reconfigure the plugin.
* The administrator can now configure the permissions of the directories and files in the cache. This way you can adapt to several different environments with different permissions needs.
* The method that saved the options was separated. Now there is a way to save the options for each tab. This will facilitate development.
* Now it is possible to configure the User Agent.
* An option has been added that allows you to decide whether the User Agent is sent to the gravatar.com and resmush.it services.
* The plugin configuration pages have been improved. Making the configuration on mobile devices normal.
* Added an option to enable the use of query strings with avatars (Suggested by @rcgoncalves).

= 1.2.2 =

* The wrong name in a variable did not let you use a custom avatar.

= 1.2.1 =

* In the last update were not added some templates, lack of attention.

= 1.2.0 =

* A new tab has been added that gives you access to a sample configuration for NGinx Server.
* A new tab has been added that allows you to create / delete / update the .htaccess file.
* The .htaccess file is no longer created automatically whenever the options are saved.
* The default optimization is disabled.
* The default learning mode is disabled.

= 1.1.1 =

* Compatibility check with wordpress version 4.9.6.
* Modify message for translation

= 1.1.0 =

* I removed the email column from the table because it was only needed for debugging purposes.
* I added a new action so that when a user is deleted all associated avatars are removed from the cache. This is important for reasons of cache space as well as for adapting to RGPD, which the user has the right to be forgotten.

= 1.0.9 =

* Compatibility check with wordpress version 4.9.5.

= 1.0.8 =

* Compatibility check with wordpress version 4.9.4.

= 1.0.7 =

* Compatibility check with wordpress version 4.9.3.

= 1.0.6 =

* Compatibility check with wordpress version 4.9.3.

= 1.0.5 =

* Compatibility check with wordpress version 4.9.2.

= 1.0.4 =

* Modified the bp_core_fetch_avatar_url filter to be added only when ajax requests are made. This way preventing duplicate processing of avatars.

= 1.0.3 =

* Now the new sizes are added if they appear in the background. In order to anticipate the actions of the users so that it is avoided to solve the gravatars at the moment.
* It was resolved how to add a new avatar of greater dimension than the existing ones in cache. It is slow because the avatar is resolved at the moment, however it is always shown the same avatar regardless of size. This is important when using avatars of different sizes at the same time, as is the case with buddypress.
* Now it is possible to also handle bp_core_fetch_avatar_url filter. So the avatars that are part of the buddypress automatic popup menu suggestions already use the cache.

= 1.0.2 =

* Added option to precompress .SVG files.
* When uninstalling the plugin, it is cleaned by removing the options used by it, removing the used table as well as the cache directory.
* Added verification of the PHP modules needed for the correct operation of the plugin.
* Solve a problem in the updateCache function in order to update the last check of a gravatar even when it has not changed.
* Repairing the Portuguese translation in the .po file.

= 1.0.1 =

* Now the default avatars are already optimized.

= 1.0 =

* First realese
